# Movie Recommendation System

This repository contains an end-to-end movie recommendation system built using machine learning techniques, data analysis, NLTK for text processing, CountVectorizer for feature extraction, cosine similarity for recommendation, and TMDB API for fetching movie data.

## Overview
The movie recommendation system analyzes and cleans movie data, applies natural language processing techniques, and uses machine learning algorithms to recommend movies based on user input. The cosine similarity metric is employed to find similarities between movies, providing personalized recommendations.

## Features
- Data Analysis and Cleaning
- NLTK for Text Processing
- CountVectorizer for Feature Extraction
- Cosine Similarity for Recommendation
- Integration with TMDB API for Movie Data
- Deployment using Streamlit

## Usage
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone <https://github.com/Bramitha-gowda-M/Movie-Recommendation-System>
